-- fct_sales
-- One row = one sale (reference_id, campaign_name, total_amount)
-- This model creates the transactional fact table:
--   - calculates company_revenue (total + rebill â€“ returned)
--   - adds order/return dates in three time zones (Kyiv, UTC, New York)
--   - calculates days_to_return (difference between return and purchase)
--   - removes duplicates by keeping the latest order per (reference_id, campaign_name, total_amount)
--   - excludes rows where campaign_name = 'n/a'
